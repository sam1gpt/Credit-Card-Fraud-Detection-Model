-> Developed a credit card fraud detection model using Python and scikit-learn.
-> Utilized pandas DataFrame for data manipulation and preprocessing.
-> Implemented under-sampling to achieve a balanced distribution between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
-> Applied logistic regression for binary classification, ensuring equal representation of both classes.
-> Achieved high accuracy scores of 94.975% on training data and 94.642% on test data.
-> Used scikit-learn's train_test_split function for dataset splitting and evaluation.
